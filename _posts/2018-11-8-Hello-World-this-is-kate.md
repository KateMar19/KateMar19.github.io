My beginning

**My introduction**

Well for starters, my name is Kate Mar. I'm 16 years old , born and raised in Dallas, Texas. I'm currently attending El Centro college. When I have free time, I read and catch up on my TV shows and do a little research on cardiovascular and neurology. I've always had a passion for helping others. I want to be a brain and heart surgeon. because i have 2 sick sibling and when i was little i promised them i would help them and i always keep my promises. I choose cardiovascular surgeon because my big sister has a hole through her heart which has caused a major problem with her life. Another reason I chose the path to be a neurosurgeon is because, my baby brother has a brain problem that affects his vision. I want to be the one to help him. I based my goals on helping my siblings because i know the would push me beyond my limit and the are the reason for me to keep trying for what I believe. "***Close off your inner demons and fight for others in need***"-K.M. This quote inspires me to shut out all of the negativity coming my way and help those who are in need.

**My future**

As I mentioned before, I am a student at El Centro college. This program has changed my life for the better because it gives me the opportunity to chase my other dream in creating my own business page. I chose the Information Technology over business because I always wanted to create my own page, a page were I get to help people in need. I'm also in this program because its my back up plan in case my dream job don't work out. This program gives me so many opportunities in having a good job. It also helps my dream job because in the future technology is going to be more advance and i know for a fact that the machines operating the surgery are going to need programming and I'll be one of the people help program the machines.

I feel like I've talked a lot about my plans and hopes for the future. So I'm going to talk about my current life. My life right now is kind of complicated because I honestly have no plan. By plan I mean, I haven't figured out nor set my life on the path to my dr4eam career. I currently do tennis and to be honest I'm pretty good. I just need to put more work into it. I also have been studying a little about cardiovascular and neurology but, I recently have been slacking off because I'm learning new languages like Italian and Dutch. I have a lot of things on my plate but, I'll manage..

**Random stuff**

My motivation to keep going right now is my father. I know he's not physically here with me but, he's here in spirit. I know for a fact that he would be proud of me and my accomplishments. I have made some mistakes but, you learn from your mistakes and I'll keep pushing  until i go beyond my limit.

Well i have officially ran out of ideas to write so, I'm just going to ramble about nonsense until i reach 600 words. Today has been a good day because it's been quiet and chill.
